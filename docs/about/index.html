<div class="content"><h1>Who is Joe Hall?</h1>
<img alt="Super Joe!" src="/assets/images/super-joe.png" class="paragraph-image">
<p>Joseph Hall has been a professional software developer since 1991. He worked as a programmer for Microsoft, IBM, and Thoughtworks, he was the software architect for a Fortune 500 bank, he was the CTO of an online ticket sales and servicing company, and he started his own consulting companies (Codetopia, LLC) in 2006 and (Ososoft, LLC) in 2016. Why 2 LLCs? It was easier to create a new company when I moved to Georgia than to transfer my existing company to a new state as a &quot;foreign&quot; LLC.</p>
<p>Joe makes his living writing desktop, web, and mobile device applications for businesses and governmental agencies, but game programming is his passion, and it was gaming that got him into programming in the first place. He was a member of the original Xbox team and he joined the Visual Studio .NET team just after the Xbox was released in 2001.</p>
<p>He is the author of <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1JuxvD8">XNA Game Studio Express: Developing Games for Windows and the Xbox 360</a></em>, which was published in 2007, and <em>Fauxcabulary: Fake Definitions, Real Funny</em>, which was self-published in 2015 (for <a href="https://leanpub.com/fauxcabulary">eBook</a> and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/joseph-hall/fauxcabulary/paperback/product-22179468.html">print</a>). He has several new books in the pipeline including a multi-volume series on MonoGame development and a techno-thriller trilogy set in the not-so-distant future.</p>
<p>Joe lives with his wife and three daughters in Newnan, Georgia. In his free time, Joe dabbles in sketching, cartooning, and creating 3D models. When you see his <a href="http://groundh0g.deviantart.com/">artistic</a> <a href="https://fauxcabulary.org/gallery/">creations</a>, you’ll understand why he makes his living as a programmer.</p>
<h1>What is MoreOnCode.com?</h1>
<p>I have a lot of varied hobbies ... a lot of them. It’s hard to tie such a motley collection together, so I picked a tongue-in-cheek name for a website and posted a bunch of links to my other sites. Well, I did. Until I landed the domain I've been waiting to go on the market for 15 years, <a href="https://joehall.net">JoeHall.net</a>. So, now, MoreOnCode will serve as an archive for my game programming camps until I get around to doing them again.</p>
<p>In early 2015, I started a new adventure – working as a software developer for ThoughtWorks, Inc, in Atlanta, GA. After a while back in the independent contracting world, I returned to Thoughtworks in 2021. In my new roles as Senior Consultant and Technical Lead, I’m immersed in agile, extreme programming, and test-driven development methodologies. This old dog is learning new tricks! In all likelihood, I’ll blog about those experiences here as well.</p>
